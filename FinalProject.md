# Final Project

Due on **December 22nd**.

You have a lot of flexibility to do a small, computational project on some models
related to the course.

For example, it could be (you don't have to choose one of them)
1. A small change to McCall models (adding taxes, changing agent types)
2. A tweak on the RBC model
3. Use some of the income fluctuation problems for asset pricing
...

A few guidelines for the deliverable:

1. Submit as an executed Jupyter notebook (.ipynb). Feel free to submit any
supplementary material if you find necessary.
2. It doesn't have to be long. The length can be roughly similar to problem sets
3 and 4 in terms of coding.
3. Having a model equivalent or very similar to what we discussed is fine, but innovations are
recommended.
4. Explain in plain words on what you implement and what you find. Showing
the economic intuition behind the models is a huge plus.
5. **List the references**. There will be a penalty if I find out that some
crucial parts of your final project are quoted from somewhere without reference.

## (Optional) Project Proposal
**Whether you submit this or not will not change the grade of your final project**.
Due on **December 12th**. Before this date you can submit some proposals for me
to check whether you are on the right track. Or we can discuss what you want to
implement for your final project.
